As corona virus hit our everyday life we were made to stay at home in lockdown, and everyday work was going online and work from home. From shopping online to ordering food , the whole industry was running from home in online mode. As a matter of fact examinations that were previously held offline was also being taken in online mode from computers. But in online mode examinations canâ€™t be invigilated properly due to absence of teachers or invigilators.
So The concept is to make a examination system for Online application, where it can be invigilated using AI (Deep learning model) for any kind of malpractice. In the web application system the web-cam of the client system will take pictures with a certain interval of time. Those pictures will be sent to the backend server for verification and detection if the pictures contains a human facing forward on his/her computer screen or not.
It can detect things such as :
1. No presence of human.
2. Fake Image of a human.
3. Can classify between real Human from Human like objects.
